# Car Insurance Data Exploratory Analysis using SAS

## Data
I have with me the car insurance claims dataset assigned to me as a part of my coursework for 'Predictive Analytics using SAS' at The University of Texas at Dallas.

## Problem Statement
I have used the dataset to answer the following questions using SAS:
* What is the distribution of gender, vehicle size, and vehicle class?
* What is the average customer life time value of each level of gender, vehicle size, and vehicle class?
* Do Large cars have a higher lifetime value than medsize cars. Do a ttest and report on your findings.
* Is there a significant difference between men and women in customer life time value?
* Use ANOVA to test whether there is difference in customer lifetime value across different sales channels. Which sales channel generates the highest lifetime value?
* Is there a relationship between renew_offer_type and response (use Chi-sq test)? Which offer type generates the highest response rate?
* Do different renew_offer_types have different lifetime values? Which offer type is the best?
* Is the effectiveness of renew_offer_type different across different states with respect to lifetime value?
